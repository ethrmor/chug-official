The 2022 fantasy season is now nearly a quarter of the way complete.

A 2-1 Direwolves team made a statement to the rest of the league after an utter dominate performance in Week 3's (not much of a) Game of the Week.

The Redbirds and Kraken both skated by as they post season-low scores, but are able to come out of the week unscathed and 3-0 as they faced two of the three lowest scoring teams on the week.

The 45ers finished off the Cowboys in a landslide to go 2-1, while the Unorthodox Rabbis upset the Slayton Slayerz en route to the week's 2nd highest score.

The Outkasts dropped their week 3 match-up to the defending champion Leprechauns.

Week 4 features two heavyweight bouts between the 1-2 Slayton Slayerz and 3-0 Kingston Kraken and the Game of the Week between the 3-0 River City Redbirds and 2-1 Direwolves.

As week 3 is now in the books, we also have our first set of [power rankings](https://chugleague.com/league/power-rankings), which were released today. Check out who starts the season as number 1.
