Week 1 is in the books.

An amazing QB-WR duo, a week one upset, and utter domination from top teams.

In a rematch of the 2021 Chug Cup Final and the ASMC Game of the Week, the Slayerz dropped a heartbreaker to the Leprechauns as Bills' QB Josh Allen and WR Stefon Diggs connected on a deep touchdown in route to a 57 point outburst.

Two of the top contenders, River City and the Direwolves got off to a hot start with near 30 and 60 points wins. The Kraken and Goathouse Alums came out hot in their matchup and showed that they could be teams to be reckoned with this season. A preseason favorite, the Outkasts, dropped a stunner to the new kid on the block, the Unorthodox Rabbis, in a low scoring battle.

Week 2's Game of the Week features two of the top Chug Cup contenders in the Kingston Kraken and the Direwolves.
