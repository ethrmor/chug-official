As the 2021 fantasy football season wraps up and COVID-19 (hopefully) winds down, it is time for the announcement of the 2021 Alliance of Sunday Morning Chugs awards. Due to extenuating circumstances, the awards were hand chosen by the Chug League Commissioner. We anticipate the 2022 awards will return to a league vote, but frankly, who knows. With that said, let's roll with the announcement.

## Owner Awards

### Robert Kraft Trophy

The Robert Kraft Trophy is given to the league's top owner. The winner of the Kraft Trophy has shown an ability to build and curate the league's best roster through trades, drafts, and a little bit of luck. The previous winner of the Kraft Trophy is Cameron, owner of the White Panthers.

**2021 Winner:** _45ers, Shawn_

Unfortunately, the 45ers were unable to win the Chug Cup in 2022, but it was clear all year they were the best team. Not only did the 45ers secure the number 1 overall seed and the all-too-crucial first round bye, they led the league in scoring by nearly 200 points. To put that into context, the second place Slayton Slayerz were closer in points scored to the 9th place Outkasts than they were to the 45ers. The offseason acquisiton of Cooper Kupp, 2021's highest scoring non-QB player, will go down as one of the best trades in the League's short history.

### Mike Brown Trophy

The Mike Brown Trophy is given to the league's worst owner. The winner (or loser) of this award has failed to accomplish their goal of winning in fantasy football. The previous winner of the Brown Trophy is Dan, owner of the Baba Yagas.

**2021 Winner:** _Baba Yagas, Dan_

The first repeat winner a Chug award is the Baba Yagas. There is no doubt that the Baba Yagas suffered from some brutal bad luck, but a complete reluctance to attempt an upgrade to their team. The beautiful thing about dynasty football is everyone can have their own strategy, most of which can at least be somewhat viable. However, the Baba Yagas refused to try in the face of a one-win season.

### Tom Brady Trophy

The Tom Brady Trophy is given to the owner with the best draft pick from the rookie draft. Some (most) will say that it is silly to choose the best pick of a rookie draft after only one season, but alas, we find ourselves needing to crown a winner. Last year's winner of the Brady Trophy was the White Panthers for drafting James Robinson in the 30th round of the startup.

**2021 Winner:** _Ja'Marr Chase - Quarantine Cowboys, Brian_

There is a legitimate case for all five of the first five picks as best pick of the draft. However, at the time of this writing, there is one player widely seen as most valuable in dynasty circles. Ja'Marr Chase lived up to his elite college billing in year one, despite the preseason reports of his football value death. In the coming years, we may come to recognize Kyle Pitts as the best pick from this draft, but he will have to prove his unicorn status on the field before he's crowned the best.

### Ryan Leaf Trophy

The Ryan Leaf Trophy is given to the owner with the worst draft pick from the rookie draft. Same as with the Brady Trophy, it may be too early to crown worst pick, but that will not stop us. Last year's winner of the Leaf Trophy was the Quarantine Cowboys for their choice of Derrius Guice in the 8th round of the startup.

**2021 Winner:** _Trey Sermon - Jeff City Leprechauns, Caleb_

The winner of the Leaf Trophy came down to a three horse race between the picks of Trey Sermon (7th overall), Justin Fields (8th), and Terrace Marshall (10th). While many believe Fields was a reach by the Direwolves, the Sermon pick was a real head scratcher. The Marshall pick was a pick that made sense at the time as many expected big things from the LSU-product that produced despite sharing a field with Justin Jefferson, Ja'Marr Chase, and Kayshon Boutte. Fields is a Konami QB that could still return value on his price in his second year. Sermon was a late riser up draft boards after a lackluster college career who could see himself out of the league within 3 years.

### Lawrence Taylor Trophy

The Lawrence Taylor Trophy is given to the owner who made the best transaction of the year. While no one player can carry a team by himself, finding a "league winner" in the offseason can propel a team to the playoffs. Last year's winner of the Taylor Trophy was the Quarantine Cowboys for their signing of free-agent Mike Davis.

**2021 Winner:** _45ers, Shawn_

The acquisition of Cooper Kupp in the 2021 offseason went on to help the 45ers to the league's best record and scoring title. Kupp's incredible season has gone down as one of the best fantasy season's of all time. Kupp not only helped the 2021 45ers, but will help them for the foreseeable future.

### Herschel Walker Trophy

The Herschel Walker Trophy is given to the owner who made the worst transaction of the year. One thing about fantasy football is that even the best trades can blow up without notice. Sometimes a trade can look bad from the beginning, other times it can turn a prince into a frog. Last year's winner of the Walker Trophy was the Baba Yagas for trading away 3 first round picks for Ezekiel Elliot.

**2021 Winner:** _Slayton Slayerz, Jacob_

This year's winner of the Walker Trophy is a winner by default. Thankfully, the league as a whole has gotten much better at both making trades and trades that aren't horribly uneven. An overpay at the time, the Slayerz acquisition of Clyde Edwards-Helaire from the 45ers turned into a brutal beat. In exchange for CEH, the Slayerz gave up an ascending WR Michael Pittman, in addition to a 1st, 2nd, and 3rd round picks. In the grand scheme of things, CEH could still return some value, but surely the Slayerz regret this move.

### Pac-Man Jones Trophy

The Pac-Man Jones Trophy is given to the owner who had the best luck of the year. Fantasy football is 80%+ luck. In order to win the Chug Cup, you have to have some luck go your way. Last year's winner of the Jones Trophy was the Jeff City Leprechauns.

**2021 Winner:** _Slayton Slayerz, Jacob_

The Slayton Slayerz entered the year as one of the favorites to win the 2021 Chug Cup. With a roster full of talented players, only injuries would keep the Slayerz down. In fact, the Slayerz did encounter some bad luck with many injuries and underperformances despite their top-2 record and scoring. And while the Slayerz did fall short of a Chug Cup in the final, the unexpected seasons of Patterson, Conner, Knox, and more surely made up for the bad and willed the Slayerz all the way to the Cup.

### Takeo Spikes Trophy

The Takeo Spikes Trophy is given to the owner who had the worst luck of the year. When I said fantasy football is 80%+ luck, I meant it. Unfortunately for some, a bad schedule, injuries, and underperformances can lead to disappointment. Last year's winner of the Spikes Trophy was the Quarantine Cowboys.

**2021 Winner:** _Silverbacks, Ethan_

The Silverbacks entered the league's second season as a playoff favorite for the second straight year. The 2021 Silverbacks missed the playoffs for a second straight year, despite finishing the season with 6th most points. The Silverbacks also underformed Win Expectation by over .200 finishing with a record of 5-9 with an expected record of 8-6.

## Player Awards

### Peyton Manning MVP Trophy

The Peyton Manning MVP Trophy is given to the league's Most Valuable Fantasy Player. Last year's winner of the Manning MVP Trophy was Travis Kelce.

**2021 Winner:** _Josh Allen - Jeff City Leprechauns, Caleb_

### Adrian Peterson Trophy

The Adrian Peterson Trophy is given to the league's Offensive Rookie of the Year. Last year's winner of the Peterson Trophy was James Robinson.

**2021 Winner:** _Najee Harris - 45ers, Shawn_

### Patrick Willis Trophy

The Patrick Willis Trophy is given to the league's Defensive Rookie of the Year. Last year's winner of the Willis Trophy was Jeremy Chinn.

**2021 Winner:** _Micah Parsons - Silverbacks, Ethan_

## Postseason Team Awards

### Chug Cup

The Chug Cup is given to the Alliance of Sunday Morning Chugs Champion. Last year's winner of the Chug Cup was the Jeff City Leprechauns.

**2021 Winner:** _Jeff City Leprechauns, Caleb_

### Marshall Faulk Trophy

The Marshall Faulk Trophy is given to the Chug League's scoring champion. Last year's winner of the Faulk Trophy was the White Panthers.

**2021 Winner:** _45ers, Shawn_
