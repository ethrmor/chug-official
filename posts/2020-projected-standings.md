The White Panthers find themselves on top of the world after the projected standings for the upcoming season were released. An 11-2 record was projected for the White Panthers, who found themselves on the bad end of the worse slide in the draft power rankings. On the other end of the projections, the Silverbacks, led by the ASMC commissioner, was projected for an abysmal 1-12 record.

The talk of the town was most certainly Slayton Slayerz, who are projected to barely miss the playoffs, even with an above .500 record. Full 2020 projected win totals are scheduled to be released soon.
