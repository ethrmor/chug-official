Week 2 has come and gone and saw a bit of a snoozefest.

As the week wrapped up, only one game finished closer than 10 points.

For a second straight week, the Josh Allen-Stefon Diggs combo went nuclear, leading the Leprechauns to a decisive victory over the 1-0 Unorthodox Rabbis. The Quarantine Cowboys rebounded from their week 1 loss to win their week 2 bye to the Macdaddys, despite finishing 10th in points on the week.

River City led the league in points as they trounced the 45ers and the Kingston Kraken came out on top against the Direwolves to jump out to 2-0 records.

The Goathouse Alums and Slayton Slayerz also got in the win columns with wins over the winless Panthers and Outkasts.

Week 3's Game of the Week is between a couple of 1-1 teams hellbent on the Chug Cup as Christian McCaffrey and the Direwolves face Patrick Mahomes and the Goathouse Alums.

Following week 3, the first iteration of the Chug League Power Rankings will be released.
