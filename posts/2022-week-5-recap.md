In what would end up becoming the best game of the week, the White Panthers dropped a barnburner against the Redbirds, despite locking in the fifth highest points on the week. The Redbirds yet again underperformed their projections, however can somewhat be explained away by two offensive starters (Nyheim Hines, Tee Higgins) leaving their respective games in the 1st quarters with only a combined 2 touches.

For the second time in five weeks, the Slayton Slayerz find a way to lose by less than 3 points. In a battle of the "nobody should win this" game, the Slayerz scored only one touchdown outside of quarterback Joe Burrow, while the Goathouse Alums weren't able to scratch across any non-QB touchdowns.

Week 5 saw two crazy blowouts as the Travis Kelce-led Direwolves dominated the Quarantine Cowboys while the lowly Macdaddys dropped an 80 point loss to the Outkasts.

The final two games of the week saw the Jeff City Leprechauns move to 5-0 over the 3-2 Kingston Kraken and the 3-2 45ers easily handeled the Rabbis.

Week 6's Game of the Week features 2-3 Slayton Slayerz vying for a playoff spot against the 3-2 45ers.
