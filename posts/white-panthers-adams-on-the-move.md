The ASMC offseason has been buzzing early with a trade flurry as the 2021 league year opened. The latest trade involves a couple of 2020 Chug Cup playoff teams as the Midwest Macdaddys trade multiple first round picks for Green Bay wide receiver Davante Adams.

The full trade includes the White Panthers sending the 2021 3.07 rookie pick in addition to Adams to the Macdaddys for Jets receiver Corey Davis, Falcons running back Ito Smith, the 2021 1.10, and the Macdaddys 2022 first and second round picks.

Consensus around the league likes the trade for the Macdaddys. One owner was quoted saying "(Macdaddys owner) Juice gets the edge on this", while another owner was quoted saying "Good for you, (Juice)".

Silverbacks owner Ethan Morris, wrote "it's just a ton" in reference to the amount of assets the Macdaddys gave up. "I think (White Panthers owner) Cameron did well securing top dollar for a soon-to-be declining asset in Adams at his peak. That's what a good dynasty manager should do," said Morris. "Adams gives the Macdaddys a top tier starting roster with a good chance to compete for the 2021 Chug Cup."

Both the Panthers and Macdaddys will look to get back to the playoffs for a second consecutive year when the 2021 NFL season returns in September.
