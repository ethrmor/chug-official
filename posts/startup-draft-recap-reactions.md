Here is a breakdown of the draft players by position:

- 42 Quarterbacks
- 91 Running Backs
- 125 Wide Receivers

- Arizona Cardinals (15)
- Green Bay Packers (15)
- New England Patriots (15)
- Cincinnati Bengals (14)
- Houston Texans (14)
- Los Angeles Rams (14)
- Pittsburgh Steelers (14)

Below we look at each team’s draft and break down some of their picks.

### Slayton Slayerz

With the first pick in the draft, the Slayerz chose RB Christian McCaffrey. As the draft went on, however, the Slayerz’ draft was highly criticized by fans and the media. In the league-wide voted draft power rankings, the Slayerz found themselves in the bottom three in each of the three releases. They did, however, gain minimal votes each release with a trending arrow upwards. Overall, the Slayerz will compete for a playoff spot behind the workhouse, Christian McCaffrey, while maintaining possibly the highest ceiling and lowest floor in the league.

**Best Pick:** _RB Christian McCaffrey, Carolina_

One of the easiest picks at the top of a 2020 startup draft, Christian McCaffrey is the safest bet to lead the league in fantasy points for the next 2-3 years. CMC can will even the worst of teams to the playoffs almost by himself.

**Worst Pick:** _RB Anthony McFarland, Pittsburgh_

With Benny Snell and Jaylen Samuels both left on the board, the Slayerz went with the rookie out of Maryland, Anthony McFarland, with the last pick of the 12th round. McFarland will start out as the fourth RB on the depth chart and won’t likely see meaningful snaps in 2020 without a few breaks going his way. McFarland doesn’t project as a 3-down back so his best case scenario is likely RB2/3.

**Best Value:** _LB Fred Warner, San Francisco_

One of the crown jewels from the stacked linebacker class of 2018, Fred Warner has the upside of a top 5 fantasy linebacker in what figures to be a defense that’s primed to regress and an offense that lacks a certain level of firepower. Drafted as LB13 in the 18th round, Warner was a complete no-brainer to anchor the middle for the Slayerz.

**Biggest Sleeper:** _TE Jonnu Smith, Tennessee_

One tight end being talked about within many expert circles, Jonnu Smith, is an absolute specimen. An athletic freak with as much upside as any tight end in the league, Smith will serve as a top 3 target for Ryan Tannehill. If Tennessee’s defense takes a step back or Derrick Henry regresses, Smith could see a major uptick in targets as the Titans will find themselves in more situations playing from behind.

**Biggest Risk:** _WR D.K. Metcalf, Seattle_

Drafted as the WR16, Metcalf doesn’t have much room for error. While many have compared facets of Metcalf’s game to Calvin Johnson, the upside is definitely there with Metcalf. The talent and growth we saw from Metcalf in his freshman year only go to further the belief he can be a stud in the league. With that said, drafting him as a high-end WR2 puts Metcalf in a spot where he has to see a massive growth in targets, become much more efficient, or see be a league leader in touchdowns. This is all certainly possible, but he’s got Tyler Lockett in front of him, as well as a coach who is very much run first.

**Most Likely to Lead the Team in 3 Years:** _RB Jonathan Taylor, Indianpolis_

It could be argued that few players went to a better spot than Jonathan Taylor did with the Colts. Often compared to Nick Chubb, Taylor has the upside to be the best rushing back in the league. Add in running behind an offensive line projected to be among the league's best once again and you have a recipe for dominance. A few things working against Taylor are Marlon Mack and Phillip Rivers. Mack is a 1,000 yard rusher and proven starter for the Colts, who isn’t just going away this year. With an eye on the future, unless Mack is willing to take a team friendly deal, he will probably be playing elsewhere in 2021. With Rivers in Indy, Frank Reich has a competent quarterback again who can run his offense. The Colts will also likely return to a heavier pass/rush split thanks to Rivers. However, by 2021, 300/1400/10 and top 5 fantasy running back is absolutely possible.

**Draft Power Ranking:** _10th (out of 12)_

### 45ers

Blessed with the 2nd pick of the startup draft, the 45ers selected Giants RB Saquon Barkley to lead their team into the future. The 45ers then took Clyde Edward-Helaire and Aaron Jones with their 2nd and 3rd round picks to give them possibly the best backfield in the ASMC. They then used their next five picks on wide receivers and capped off their starting offense with Austin Hooper and future MVP, Drew Lock. With a strong backfield, options at receiver, and Aaron Rodgers, the 45ers should easily complete for a playoff spot.

**Best Pick:** _RB Saquon Barkley, New York Giants_

Despite the injury concerns, there is nobody with as much pure talent left on the board for the 45ers to pick. Even on bad teams and with injuries, Barkley has produced RB2 and RB10 numbers and there’s no reason to suggest he won’t do that for many more years to come.

**Worst Pick:** _WR Keenan Allen, Los Angeles Chargers_

Now that Phillip Rivers is no longer in Los Angeles, Allen will find a difficult time producing the WR1 numbers to which Allen owners have come accustomed. As long as Tyrod Taylor is running the show in Los Angeles, Allen’s ceiling is real. Once Herbert takes the reins, his arm talent is sure to help Allen out, however many have their doubts as to whether Herbert can actually become a league average quarterback. Due to the uncertainty, many are not as high on Allen’s fantasy potential as they are his football talent.

**Best Value:** _RB Aaron Jones, Green Bay_

Getting Aaron Jones in the 3rd round cannot be explained by anything other than a steal. Even with a regression in touchdowns, the Packers aren’t bleeding with talent. Someone has to carry the ball and someone has to score. Jones is the best bet out of the backfield for that, being both a good running back and an excellent receiver out of the backfield.

**Biggest Sleeper:** _WR Adam Theilen, Minnesota_

While many would not consider Adam Theilen a sleeper, he was drafted as WR22. With the lack of playmakers outside of Dalvin Cook and Theilen and an unknown defense, Theilen figures to be a mainstay when it comes to targets. The Vikings did add Justin Jefferson after sending Stefon Diggs to Buffalo, but he doesn’t project to be a major player in this offense from the get go. It is not crazy to think that Theilen could outperform his ADP and finish as a WR1 again as he did in 2018.

**Biggest Risk:** _QB Drew Lock, Denver_

There is no doubt that the Broncos are doing anything and everything they can to keep Lock from failing, from signing Melvin Gordon to drafting multiple receivers and a tight end. The Broncos also brought in Pat Shurmur to call plays and lead the offense. These changes could help propel Lock into a top 15 QB, however the jury is still out on whether or not Lock is actually good or not. It’s quite possible that no amount of weapons will help Lock become a viable option at the quarterback position.

**Most Likely to Lead the Team in 3 Years:** _RB Clyde Edwards-Helaire, Kansas City_

Anytime Andy Reid compares a guy to Brian Westbrook, people should probably listen. While coach speak is a real thing, it’s hard to watch CEH play and not see some similarities. Any player who is tied to Patrick Mahomes for 4 years should be looked as an absolute fantasy option and in a .5 PPR league, it’s not exactly difficult to look at CEH and his situation and not see a top 5 fantasy RB upside.

**Draft Power Ranking:** _6th (out of 12)_

### Outkasts

The first surprise of the draft came when the Outkasts took Las Vegas’s RB, Josh Jacobs, with the 3rd pick in the startup draft. A trade up in the second round allowed the Outkasts to grab last year’s leading scorer, Lamar Jackson, with the 19th overall pick. The league didn’t love the start of the Outkasts’ draft, ranking him in the bottom third of the power rankings after 8 rounds. The Outkasts have some major talent, in the short term especially, that can get them to the playoffs where anything can happen.

**Best Pick:** _WR Julio Jones, Atlanta_

Even at the age of 31, Julio Jones shows few signs of slowing down. Jones has finished as WR6 or better in each of the last 5 years. Not many QB-WR duos have been as successful as Matt Ryan-Julio Jones and when the going gets tough, Ryan will continue to lean on Jones. While many receivers begin their decline at age 31, Julio Jones is quite possibly the exception to the rule.

**Worst Pick:** _RB Josh Jacobs, Las Vegas_

Few would argue that Josh Jacobs is not one of the best running backs in football. The issue with Jacobs, as a fantasy asset, is his lack of use in the passing game. With the re-signing of Jalen Richard and the draftings of Lynn Bowden, Henry Ruggs, and Bryan Edwards, targets will be even harder to find for Jacobs. There’s no doubt he’s a phenomenal pure runner who could flirt with 1,500 yards, but without 40+ receptions or major increase in touchdowns, there’s just no way he can live up to his RB3 billing.

**Best Value:** _WR Tyler Lockett, Seattle_

With the 58th pick in the draft, the Outkasts selected Tyler Lockett as the WR26. He’s still the number one receiver who has shown his value even in a run-heavy offense. In the last two years, Lockett has finished as WR15 and WR14 and there’s no reason he can’t repeat as a high-end WR2.

**Biggest Sleeper:** _RB D’Andre Swift, Detroit_

Before the NFL Draft, D’Andre Swift was looked at as arguably the best runner in his class. He goes to a team that is not chock full of talent in the running back room. Kerryon Johnson has the talent, but when you pair it with his injury risk, there’s heavy doubt he can be a true number one workhorse. Swift, on the other hand, has the talent and ability to do that, especially in a potentially high-powered offense with a great quarterback and multiple weapons who can catch the ball.

**Biggest Risk:** _TE Darren Waller, Las Vegas_

Darren Waller had quite the heartwarming story in 2019. After dealing with years of substance abuse, Waller got sober and made his return to the NFL and flashed the talent scouts had talked about. It won’t be easy for Waller to repeat his 2019 performance in 2020 as the Raiders have added a significant amount of talent on the offensive side of the ball. Now that Carr, who struggles in his own right to throw the ball downfield, has more weapons at his disposal, a reduction in Waller’s targets is certainly not out of the question.

**Most Likely to Lead the Team in 3 Years:** _RB D’Andre Swift, Detroit_

See above. Swift has a clear path to workhouse running back in an offense that hasn’t seen any semblance of a workhorse since Jonathan Stewart. With a healthy Matthew Stafford at QB, the offense will still be above average.

**Draft Power Ranking:** _8th (out of 12)_

### Jeff City Leprechauns

The Leprechauns made a lot of noise early after taking Ezekiel Elliott with the 4th overall pick in the draft. A trade of the 21st overall pick left the Leprechauns without a 2nd round pick after they traded out for an extra 3rd and to move up from the 6th to the 4th. The trade was widely lauded for the Leprechauns by the league for adding top tier talent. The Leprechauns have the talent to challenge for the inaugural Chug Cup Championship™.

**Best Pick:** _WR Ezekiel Elliott, Dallas_

Ezekiel Elliott is no doubt a top four all-around running back in the league. Pair that with a high powered offense and solid defense and you have a every week, high-floor player to anchor your team.

**Worst Pick:** _WR Cooper Kupp, Los Angeles Rams_

Cooper Kupp was a true case of Jekyll and Hyde in 2019. Through 10 weeks, Kupp paced as WR6, but failed to top 15.5 points the rest of the fantasy season. Kupp runs 88% of his routes from either the slot or tight to the line, which doesn’t bode well for a team that’s expected to continue to run primarily 12 personnel. Surely the Rams will get targets to their best receiver, but it will be tough to live up to his WR20 price unless something changes with McVey’s offense.

**Best Value:** _TE Noah Fant, Denver Broncos_

Fant was both a winner and loser from the 2020 offseason. On one hand, the Broncos added multiple talents to the offensive side of the ball, including another rookie tight end, who also happens to be Lock’s former college target. On the other hand, Fant flashed in a big way in 2019 and shows the tools to be an elite pass catching tight end. The addition of Pat Shurmur as offensive coordinator should also help Fant. Regardless, getting Fant as a TE12 leaves plenty of room to be a value pick.

**Biggest Sleeper:** _WR Terry McLaurin, Washington_

One benefit of playing with your college quarterback is the ability to capitalize on the chemistry you’ve developed. Terry McLaurin is the perfect example of this as he was able to contribute right away as a rookie on his way to a WR27 finish. With a new coaching staff and a better roster, McLaurin should be able to benefit from another year in the pros and another year of development from Dwayne Haskins.

**Biggest Risk:** _WR Mike Evans, Tampa Bay_

A wide receiver in Bruce Arian’s system will not generally be looked at as a major risk, but an up and down season in 2019 and a new quarterback in 2020 leaves a lot to be desired from a WR1. A much improved defense and a quarterback who struggled to throw the ball downfield last year makes Mike Evans a risky pick. Another year full of great games and goose eggs is definitely within the realm of possibilities for the 26-year-old receiver.

**Most Likely to Lead the Team in 3 Years:** _LB Darius Leonard, Indianapolis_

The 2nd round pick out of South Carolina State in 2018 has quickly become one of the best defensive players in all of football. Known for his playmaking abilities, Leonard seems to always be near the ball. He’s become the anchor of the Colts defense and there is no end in sight. His value above the LB2 in 2018 and his PPG in 2019 signal a value at the position which can be a big advantage in weekly games.

**Draft Power Ranking:** _3rd (out of 12)_

### Direwolves

Despite using the 5th overall pick on a wide receiver, the Direwolves were able to build a team worthy of challenging for a Chug Cup from the onset. The league agrees that the Direwolves drafted a top team, as they were voted 1st and 2nd in the last two sets of power
rankings.

**Best Pick:** _WR Michael Thomas, New Orleans_

When it comes to wide receivers, there is no more sure bet than “Can’t Guard Mike”. The most important aspect of drafting a wide receiver in the first round is a high floor. Michael Thomas has the highest floor among wide receivers after breaking Marvin Harrison’s record for receptions in season. After WR7, WR6, WR6, WR1 finishes from 2016-2019, Thomas is a lock to finish as a WR1 in 2020, if he can avoid injury.

**Worst Pick:** _RB Raheem Mostert, San Francisco_

Mostert is a classic case of recency bias. After a huge 29/220/4 performance in a playoff game against Green Bay, many forgot about Mostert’s first half of 2019 and the seasons prior. The 28-year-old, playing for his 5th team, had never had more than 34 rush attempts in a season before 2019. A decline in touchdown numbers, after 6 straight games with a touchdown to end the fantasy season, could lead to a disastrous season for the 49ers running back.

**Best Value:** _WR Odell Beckham, Jr., Cleveland_

A willingness to forget the 2019 season under Freddie Kitchens is something most would find fair. Despite some nagging injuries, Beckham found a way to play in all 16 games and finish 2 spots out of the WR2 tier. The trainwreck of a season is not something most are willing to hold against OBJ, as he’s proven to be an elite receiver and one of the best downfield threats in football early in his career. It’s not crazy to expect OBJ to finish in the top 12 of receivers under new head coach Kevin Stefanski.

**Biggest Sleeper:** _RB Ronald Jones, Tampa Bay_

Ronald Jones has been written off by many in the fantasy community. As an 8th round pick, Jones has very low risk, while maintaining a very good ceiling. When Tampa Bay drafted Ke’Shawn Vaughn, most figured Jones was done, but the numbers would say different. Jones not only finished last season strong, but he’s upgraded at the quarterback position, saw a large improvement on the defensive side of the ball, and is still younger and better than the rookie running back they just brought in. It’s not out of this world for Jones to finish as a top 24 running back in 2020 and beyond.

**Biggest Risk:** _RB Kenyan Drake, Arizona_

Drafted above his ADP, Drake was taken as the RB11 by the Direwolves with their 2nd round pick. Drake carries a large bust risk as he’s never proven he’s able to carry the full load for a whole season. He’s also never had a 1,000 all-purpose yard season so while the projection is there, the results haven’t been to this point. With that said, Drake flashed in a major way in 2019 after his trade to the Cardinals. Nobody in football runs more out of 10 personnel than Kliff Kingsbury, which allows the box to stay open and lanes to develop for Drake. As long as Drake can continue his 2019 campaign, Drake will go from biggest risk to league winner in 2020.

**Most Likely to Lead the Team in 3 Years:** _QB Deshaun Watson, Houston_

When it comes to pure talent at the quarterback position, Watson belongs at the top of the list with the Mahomes’ and Jacksons’ of the world. His supporting cast will do nothing to help his value as a quarterback, however playing from behind will help his fantasy stock until Bill O’Brien is gone and a new regime can come in and build around this franchise quarterback.

**Draft Power Ranking:** _2nd (out of 12)_

### White Panthers

After selecting New Orleans’ Alvin Kamara with their first pick in the startup draft, the White Panthers continued to build a strong core. An oft-overlooked receiver, Kenny Golladay, will lead the receiving corps after being drafted with the second round pick. Some major upside guys including DJ Chark and Kareem Hunt can help lead the White Panthers to the promised land in the inaugural drive for the Chug Cup.

**Best Pick:** _RB Alvin Kamara, New Orleans_

Thanks to some good luck, the White Panthers were able to grab a solidified top 5 talent when Kamara dropped to them at the 6th pick. If Kamara can avoid injury, he could be in for a major touchdown regression after his career-low 6 touchdown campaign in 2019. Returning to his 2017-2018 form is a bet the White Panthers were willing to make.

**Worst Pick:** _TE Mike Gesicki, Miami_

With Ryan Fitzpatrick still at the helm and Tua waiting in the wings, the Dolphins offense won’t be expected to do huge numbers this season. After adding to the running backs group in free agency and getting back their wide receivers to healthy, the targets will not be as plentiful to Gesicki as they were at the end of 2019. Unless Gesicki can improve on his efficiency, which may be more of a quarterback problem, he may not be able to live up to his TE8 price tag.

**Best Value:** _WR DJ Chark, Jr., Jacksonville_

Doug Marrone will be gone. Gardner Minshew will be gone. One of Trevor Lawrence, Justin Fields, or Trey Lance will be under center. 2021 and beyond are trending up for Chark. When it comes to the 2020 season, Chark could be in for a major role on a team that, let’s say....lacks talent. Someone has to catch the ball and Chark may be the only one capable of doing it regularly this season. Jacksonville figures to be down early and often so Chark could see a finish way above his WR19 price.

**Biggest Sleeper:** _RB Kareem Hunt, Cleveland_

Kareem Hunt isn’t your traditional sleeper as most in the fantasy world have heard of the former RB1. However, not many players drafted at RB27 have legitimate RB1 upside. Hunt is one Chubb injury from taking over in a run-heavy offense with a possibility of a share of 250 carries and 50 catches available in that scenario. Even without a Chubb injury, Hunt can put up RB2 numbers as Stefanski and crew love to run the ball and it’s definitely within the realm of possibilities that the Cleveland offense can spit out two top 24 running backs.

**Biggest Risk:** _WR Kenny Golladay, Detroit_

Kenny Golladay is coming off of a season that saw him finish as WR6, even after losing Stafford after Week 9. The Northern Illinois product oozes talent and is a clear cut NFL number one receiver. When it comes to fantasy, though, Golladay is much more boom-or-bust than you want out of a WR1. While his five 21+ point game performances can win you those weeks, his five games under 10 can lead to losses and be infuriating for an owner. With that said, Golladay is entering what should be a productive prime of his career.<br /><br />

**Most Likely to Lead the Team in 3 Years:** _WR DJ Chark, Jr., Jacksonville_

See above. Chark has the tools to be a true WR1 when paired with an above average quarterback. If Chark continues to develop and the Jaguars are able to get one of the three 2021 quarterbacks in the draft, Chark could see an immediate bump in value become a leader for the White Panthers.

**Draft Power Ranking:** _4th (out of 12)_

### Goathouse Alums

No franchise may be set up better to compete for the Chug Cup from the start. The Goathouse Alums their first four picks to secure top players at the quarterback, running back, and tight end positions. While the wide receivers look lackluster at first glance, the upside is real and could lead to the Goathouse Alums becoming the first dynasty of the ASMC.

**Best Pick:** _TE Travis Kelce, Kansas City_

While all twelve franchises shied away from the 30-year-old tight end out of Kansas City for the first two and a half rounds, the Goathouse Alums pulled the trigger and selected a sure-fire top 3 tight end for at least the 2020 season. Kelce hasn’t shown any signs of slowing down and as long as he’s tied to Mahomes and Andy Reid, he’ll be a premier option at a premier position for the foreseeable future.

**Worst Pick:** _RB Phillip Lindsay, Denver_

You know you’ve done something right when your worst pick is a running back with a good track record that was drafted in the 8th round. The Lindsay pick says more about the Goathosue Alums draft than it does Lindsay. The downside of Lindsay comes with the addition of Melvin Gordon to the Broncos offense. Lindsay will give up some opportunities to Gordon, but still stands to benefit with any Gordon inefficiency or injuries.

**Best Value:** _RB Todd Gurley II, Atlanta_

Let’s not forget that merely 2 seasons ago, Gurley was RB1, which he did in only 14 games played. In 2019, Gurley still finished as the RB14. One of the most overblown issues facing Todd Gurley is his arthritis. It’s an issue that he’s faced since college and it hasn’t slowed him down. That’s not to say that Gurley isn’t more likely to get hurt than other backs, because he definitely carries more risk, but expect Atlanta to feed Gurley the rock and Gurley to finish in the top 12 running backs again in 2020.

**Biggest Sleeper:** _WR John Ross III, Cincinnati_

John Ross was quietly putting up over 10 points per game before his injury in 2019. After adding Joe Burrow to the team, the Bengals offense looks primed to be able to score points and Ross should benefit from that. He’s going to hold down the deep stretch role for the Bengals and could definitely see an uptick in usage as the Bengals are projected to be bad yet again. Ross also holds some appeal as his 5th year option was declined, but his pedigree alone will be able to get him another opportunity or two with a different team if he decides to leave Cincy.

**Biggest Risk:** _RB Dalvin Cook, Minnesota_

When Dalvin Cook is available at pick 7, you jump at the opportunity to add some of the best talent in the NFL. But as most know, Cook carries the most risk out of all first round picks. Cook had not played more than 11 games until the 14 he played in last season. Even at Florida State, Cook was oft-injured so there’s no reason to believe he’ll just instantly become durable. With that said, when he’s healthy, he’s clearly one of the top five backs in fantasy.

**Most Likely to Lead the Team in 3 Years:** _WR CeeDee Lamb, Dallas_

Just as the Cowboys were shocked and delighted for Lamb to fall to them in the draft, the Goathouse Alums have to be excited for Lamb to fall to them in the 5th round. Lamb was considered the top talent at receiver in the draft and went to a team with a high-powered offense, elite quarterback, and offensive coordinator who has shown willingness to throw the football. Lamb has the upside of a 6 wide receiver in fantasy.

**Draft Power Ranking:** _1st (out of 12)_

### Macdaddys

Anchored by arguably the most underrated wide receiver corps in the ASMC, the top tight end in dynasty, and an elite quarterback, the Macdaddys have as good of a shot as anyone in the league at making the playoffs and rolling the dice at the Chug Cup. The ability of the Macdaddys to build both a team that can compete this year and into the future is something only quality owners are able to navigate.

**Best Pick:** _TE George Kittle, San Francisco_

The only proven receiving option at Jimmy G’s disposal is the big man out of Iowa, George Kittle. The 26-year-old pass catcher is just now entering his prime after putting up back-to-back top 3 finishes at the tight end position. He’s geared up and ready to take over the TE1 spot from Kelce and could do it as early as this season.

**Worst Pick:** _RB Chris Carson, Seattle_

Hip injuries are not a fun injury to navigate, especially when it comes to running backs. When you pair the injury with a run-heavy offense, the risk of re-injury goes way up. In addition to the injury, Carson has both Rashaad Penny and fourth-round pick, DeeJay Dallas, nipping at his heels if things start to go south for the Oklahoma State product. Add in the new signing of Carlos Hyde and a potential PUP start for Carson and things could go downhill quickly.

**Best Value:** _WR T.Y. Hilton, Indianapolis_

The tale of T.Y. is that of Andrew Luck vs bad quarterbacks. With Luck under center, Hilton is a top 15 wide receiver. Without Luck, Hilton falls into the WR3 tier at best. Part of this is due to the complete ineptitude of Indianapolis quarterbacks outside of Luck during Hilton’s tenure in Indy. Hilton finally started succumbing to injuries last year by missing more games in 2019 than his previous seven seasons combined. With Rivers in town, don’t be shocked if T.Y. returns to form and finishes in the conversation of top 15-20 fantasy receivers.

**Biggest Sleeper:** _WR Robert Woods, Los Angeles Rams_

Robert Woods is the clear-cut number one receiver on the outside for Sean McVey and the Rams. Once the Rams went to primarily 12 personnel in the second half of last season, Woods saw at least 9 targets in each of his games. With the Rams defense expecting to take a step back, the offense might be forced to throw more and Woods could be a major benefactor of that. When it comes to fantasy football, opportunity is king and Woods may be the king of opportunity in 2020.

**Biggest Risk:** _RB Nick Chubb, Cleveland_

Once Kareem Hunt came back from his suspension, Chubb was a shell of himself from a fantasy standpoint. Now that Hunt is back full-time, Chubb could see his numbers from last year decline quite a bit and potentially fall out of the top 12 running backs. On the flip side, Chubb may be the best rushing back in football and, under Stefanski, should be able to stay in that RB1 tier.

**Most Likely to Lead the Team in 3 Years:** _QB Tua Tagovailoa, Miami_

Touted as the most talented quarterback in college football and the best NFL prospect in the draft before his hip injury, Tagovailoa has an opportunity to help turn around a lost franchise. While the hip injury is scary, all signs point to positivity with the medicals. If all goes well from an injury standpoint, there’s no doubt Tua has the ceiling to be a top five fantasy quarterback.

**Draft Power Ranking:** _5th (out of 12)_

### Silverbacks

Hated by the algorithms, but considered decent by the league, the Silverbacks as a whole are the most polarizing team coming out of the startup draft. There’s no doubt the Silverbacks drafted off of what could be while sprinkling in some high floor guys with high ceilings. From top to bottom, the Silverbacks may be the only team with higher ceilings and lower floors than the aforementioned Slayerz. More volatile than most, the Silverbacks could just as easily end up with the Chug Cup or as they could the rights to Clemson RB Travis Etienne.

**Best Pick:** _RB Joe Mixon, Cincinnati_

At the 9th pick in the draft, Mixon makes so much sense. Outside of arguably Derrick Henry, there wasn’t a player available worth the value of the pick. The addition of Joe Burrow to the offense could be a harbinger of Mixon’s ascent to top 5 fantasy running back. With no real threat to his touches, Mixon could be in line for 300+ carries and 40+ catches.

**Worst Pick:** _RB Kerryon Johnson, Detroit_

While few will deny the talent of Kerryon Johnson, many will bring up his injury history. The upside of a three-down back is real for Johnson, but he will have to prove he can stay healthy and play more than 10 games in a season. At this point, however, Johnson’s best chance of being a workhouse again is for him to find a new team as the Lions recently drafted D’Andre Swift in the second round.

**Best Value:** _WR A.J. Brown, Tennessee_

A.J. Brown is a very polarizing fantasy player. On one hand, Brown finished as WR15 in his rookie season, while putting up unsustainable efficiency numbers. On the other hand, with any sort of regression from Henry or the defense, as with Jonnu Smith, the Titans may be forced to throw more than 450 times, and in that scenario, there’s no reason Brown can’t reach 100 targets.

**Biggest Sleeper:** _TE T.J. Hockenson, Detroit_

After a solid start to his rookie campaign was derailed due to a concussion and injury to Stafford, Hockenson showed flashes of what we saw at Iowa. With a healthy quarterback, Hockenson could make that year 2 jump into fantasy relevance.

**Biggest Risk:** _WR D.J. Moore, Carolina_

D.J. Moore has done nothing but get better in each of his two years in the league out of Maryland. With Kyle Allen under center, Moore put up a line of 87/1175/4 in route to a WR18 finish. If Moore can continue to make strides, the sky is the limit with half-competent quarterback who thrives on short- to mid-yard throws. The risk with Moore in this case is living up the price tag of WR6.

**Most Likely to Lead the Team in 3 Years:** _RB J.K. Dobbins, Baltimore_

Staying on theme with running backs from the 2020 class landing in perfect situations, Dobbins lands with a team who runs out of the shotgun and RPO attempts more than any team in the league, an area where Dobbins truly excels. While 2020 may be an adjustment period for Dobbins as Ingram will likely take a bulk of the snaps, at least early, Dobbins has a chance to be a viable 2020 option, while still having upside of an RB1 tier back in 2021 and beyond.

**Draft Power Ranking:** _7th (out of 12)_

### Baba Yagas

When the league spoke after 8 rounds, the first words from the owner of the Baba Yagas were, “well fuck me” and with good reason. The league voted the first quarter of Baba Yagas’ draft as the worst in the league. When it comes to the draft, the Baba Yagas made mostly unsexy picks, which may have had a hand in the low grade. At the end of the day, the Baba Yagas are expected to miss the playoffs with Vegas setting their O/U at 5.5 wins. The talent is evident, however the downsides are real.

**Best Pick:** _WR Chris Godwin, Tampa Bay_

Even with a change at quarterback from Jameis Winston to Tom Brady, Godwin has shown flashes of being able to play with any quarterback. While it’s certainly possible the Tampa Bay offense takes a step back in terms of fantasy production, Godwin will likely stay fantasy dominant as he runs 85% in the slot or inside, where Brady loves to live. Another year of top 5 production at the wide receiver position is very well in the realm of probabilities.

**Worst Pick:** _QB Jared Goff, Los Angeles Rams_

In round 10, Goff is considered a reach by the Baba Yagas. While the Rams could have a bounceback season, the McVey magic has seemed to have worn off as teams have seemingly figured out how to slow down his offense. This could be due to Goff taking a step backwards last year. If the Rams get back to basics, Goff could certainly see a bounceback in his numbers.

**Best Value:** _WR Desean Jackson, Philadelphia_

Getting a 15th round wide receiver who will likely see a major uptick in snaps and serve as a top 2 receiver for a team who throws the ball 600 times is like striking gold. While it’s not likely we see the 2013 version of Jackson, there’s definitely a path to seeing time in the starting lineup in bye weeks or in the event of injuries.

**Biggest Sleeper:** _WR Michael Gallup, Dallas_

When CeeDee Lamb was drafted in the first round of the NFL draft by the Cowboys, most experts’ initial reaction was to downgrade Gallup. While Lamb will likely take over the number one receiver role in the future, Gallup’s future with the Cowboys may be capped at second fiddle to Lamb. However, that may not be a negative as there are plenty of targets to go around in the Dallas offense. With the departure of Cobb and Witten, there are 170 targets up for grabs between Lamb and Jarwin, which would allow Gallup the opportunity to repeat or improve upon his 2019 target share of 112. Regardless, if he can improve his catch %, a finish in the top 20 receivers won’t be a surprise.

**Biggest Risk:** _RB David Montgomery, Chicago_

A workhorse running back with an opportunity of 260+ carries will always be worth a look in fantasy. In Montgomery’s case, the Chicago offensive line did not improve this offseason, which will not make it any easier for Montgomery to take the next step. After being drafted as RB16, Montgomery will have a steep hill to climb in order to justify his expensive price. In order to do this, the Bears offense will have to take a step forward and Montgomery will have to improve upon his 3.7 yard per carry. If all goes well, Monty could see himself finish at about his draft price.

**Most Likely to Lead the Team in 3 Years:** _WR JuJu Smith-Schuster, Pittsburgh_

Like the Kitchen situation in Cleveland, nobody should hold what happened in Pittsburgh against any offensive fantasy player. While there could be an element of truth to Smith-Schuster needing Antonio Brown to take the heat off of him so he could produce, last year wasn’t the year to use it as evidence. With Ben Roethlisberger coming back healthy, Smith-Schuster will have to prove that he belongs in the WR1 conversation.

**Draft Power Ranking:** _11th (out of 12)_

### Quarantine Cowboys

According to both the Vegas algorithms and the league-voted, the Cowboys had a very average draft and mid-level team. Voted 9th best draft and an O/U of 5.5 games, the Cowboys should compete for a playoff spot in 2020. The upside is evident with guys like first round pick Miles Sanders, Cam Akers, and Henry Ruggs.

**Best Pick:** _TE Mark Andrews, Baltimore_

After his massive step forward in 2019, there’s no reason to believe that Mark Andrews isn’t the real deal. Any sort of regression on offense in Baltimore could force Jackson to throw the ball a little bit more than the 400 attempts last year. While the Ravens have added some firepower to their receiver room, Andrews is still the top dog and could easily surpass the 100 targets mark. Even with some touchdown regression to the mean, Andrews could again finish as a top 4 fantasy tight end.

**Worst Pick:** _RB Derrius Guice, Washington_

Guice has been hit with the major injury bug having had only 43 carries in his short 2-year career. With a competitive backfield like Washington and Adrian Peterson leading the team in carries, there's definite worry that Guice may not even make the team coming out of training camp this season. If that happens, Guice could try to hang on with another team due to his evident talent, but could just as easily be another “what could have been”.

**Best Value:** _WR Stefon Diggs, Buffalo_

Stefon Diggs as WR28 is a bargain, even with the change of scenery. Diggs has had 3 straight top 18 finishes among wide receivers, while lining up opposite Adam Thelien. After being traded to Buffalo, Diggs is now a clear cut number 1 receiver. This should lead to Diggs beating his ADP, despite the fact that he goes from Kirk Cousins to Josh Allen.

**Biggest Sleeper:** _RB Cam Akers, Los Angeles Rams_

After the Rams let Todd Gurley walk, there’s a massive hole in Los Angeles’ backfield. The Rams drafted Cam Akers out of Florida State in the 2nd round. Akers was a workhorse at Florida State and may slide into the 3-down back role with the Rams sooner rather than later. While it’s much easier to acclimate as a rookie running back than it is as a receiver, the lack of mini camp and training camps may push back how quickly Akers can take over the Rams backfield.

**Biggest Risk:** _RB Miles Sanders, Philadelphia_

Miles Sanders flashed RB1 potential many times in 2019. There’s no doubt that he has the ability to lead the Philly backfield for years to come. With the Eagles, however, there’s an expectation the Eagles sign a veteran running back that will likely take some touches away from Sanders. If Coach Pederson and the Eagles go into the season without adding another running back, the path to RB1 will be clear for Sanders.

**Most Likely to Lead the Team in 3 Years:** _WR Courtland Sutton, Denver_

There is a lot being made about the Broncos addition of Jerry Jeudy, KJ Hamler, and Albert O and how it will negatively affect Sutton’s touches. With Shurmur taking over the offensive play calls, there’s reason to believe the offensive will look to throw more and that the additions of the aforementioned rookies is to both get Lock some more weapons and to alleviate some of the pressure off Sutton. In a perfect world, Jeudy could play the JuJu role to Sutton’s Antonio Brown.

**Draft Power Ranking:** _9th (out of 12)_

### Herbert St Hermits

The Hermits were the most widely criticized franchise earning bottom 2 votes from 10 out of the 11 franchise owners for the worst draft in the league. The algorithms also tend to lean towards a poor 2020 season for the Hermits with a Vegas O/U of 4.5, matched only by the lowly Silverbacks. There’s a definite path to being a challenger for the Chug Cup, but they may need some help. With the talent on Herbert St, there’s no doubt finding a way into the playoffs could prove fruitful for the Hermits.

**Best Pick:** _WR Davante Adams, Green Bay_

As long as Aaron Rodgers is the quarterback in Green Bay and the management refuses to give him weapons, Adams will continue to have a ceiling as high as any receiver in football. The drops in 2020 are definitely of concern, but as long as Adams is getting 120+ targets, he’s going to be a threat to land in the WR1 tier.

**Worst Pick:** _RB Alexander Mattison, Minnesota_

While the injury and holdout concerns for the man in front of Mattison are real, there’s no doubt that Dalvin Cook is RB1 and will be given the touches as such. As long as Cook is healthy, Mattison will be nothing more than a premium handcuff with little-to-no stand alone value. In the 8th round, Mattison is considered a reach, but could become a major win if Cook misses an extended amount of time and Mattison sees enough touches to flirt with the RB2 tier.

**Best Value:** _RB Melvin Gordon III, Denver_

Melvin Gordon is expected to split carries with incumbent Phillip Lindsay after signing with the Broncos for less than what he turned down in Los Angeles. Gordon will run behind a much better offensive line than he did in Los Angeles. Only an injury to Lindsay would open enough touches for Gordon to become the RB1 he was drafted to be, however the upside is worth it being drafted at the end of the 5th round. While it’s certainly possible we see Gordon return to 2017 form, he’s on the wrong side of 27 and will likely never see workhorse touches again.

**Biggest Sleeper:** _TE Dallas Goedert, Philadelphia_

While still the number one option, Zach Ertz took a step back last year from his 2018 performance. With Dallas Goedert waiting in the wings, the Eagles could move on from Ertz if the price isn’t right, even if that isn’t likely. Regardless of Ertz, Goedert has shown major strides in his first 2 years, which was fueled by the lack of wide receivers available to Wentz. Goedert could be hurt by a move back to 11 personnel more often with the draft capital that was deployed to the wide receiver room.

**Biggest Risk:** _QB Kyler Murray, Arizona_

Kyler Murray himself is not a major risk. Trading your 3rd and 4th round picks to move up in the 2nd round to grab him in a 1QB league could be seen as a major risk. As much upside as Murray has, he still has a long way to go before he reaches the level of Mahomes and Jackson. While it’s certainly possible the Cardinals find themselves in a lot of negative game scripts, forcing Murray to throw or run, it’s no guarantee he will make that sophomore jump like Mahomes and Jackson both did. So while the upside is very real, the cost of reaching for Murray may come back to haunt the Hermits.

**Most Likely to Lead the Team in 3 Years:** _TE Dallas Goedert, Philadelphia_

See Above. Ertz will likely be on the back side of his career and Goedert will have taken over the TE1 for the Eagles, becoming a top 8 fantasy tight end.
