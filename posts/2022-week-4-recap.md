The sky is blue, water is wet, and the Jeff City Leprechauns are the league's only remaining unbeaten. Jeff City defeated the Goathouse Alums behind a season-high 32 points from RB Josh Jacobs.

In the Week 4's Game of the Week, the Direwolves took a bit out of the Redbirds in route to a decisive win. The Redbirds will look to get back on their path to the playoffs in Week 5 against the league's only 0-4 team, the White Panthers.

The Kingston Kraken dropped their first game of the year to the rebounding Slayerz of Slayton Drive, who get back to .500 in 2022.

The stinkiest game of the week saw the Macdaddys accidentally win their first game of the year against a reeling Rabbis squad fresh off the young season's most suprising week.

In the weeks final games, the 45ers lost a close one to the Outkasts, despite a top 3 weekly score, the Quarantine Cowboys took down the White Panthers.

## Power Rankings

Direwolves remain at the top of the league through 4 weeks as the top 6 teams remain the same.
