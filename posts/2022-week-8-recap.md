It only took 8 weeks, but the Leprechauns are no longer undefeated after a stunning loss to the 1-6 White Panthers. Despite the loss, Jeff City still holds onto a project bye with a lead in points scored over River City.

In other league news, the Redbirds come from behind against the Outkasts behind a late 4th quarter touchdown reception from Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins. The Outkasts nearly pulled off the upset behind outlandish outings from Tyler Allgeier, Rondale Moore, and Kalif Raymond nearly tripling their projections.

The Quarantine Cowboys celebrated a victory in spite of their low score after having the fortune of a battle against the Rabbis. The Cowboys continue you find top production from guys like Rhamondre Stevenson and a rejuventated Miles Sanders.

The 45ers got back in the win column clinching a much needed victory over the reeling Kraken. Alvin Kamara seems to be back which is something the 45ers desperately need if they want to carve out a spot in the playoffs.

Week 8 would prove to be bittersweet for the Goathouse Alums as they scored a season high 192.88, which is good for the league's third highest score of the season, but unfortunately wasted the good outing on their bye. As week 9 is upon us, we are on "Can the Macdaddys put out a lineup that doesn't have at least one zero" watch.

In the week's clash of the titans, the Direwolves put up another godly week and downed the tough-on-their-luck Slayton Slayerz in a 42-point drubbing. The Slayerz have been a top six scoring team in all but one week, yet have only a 4-4 record to show for it. Absolutely brutal.

## What Ifs

If the league were to implement a double header style schedule, which is where each team plays an additional game against the league's median score (so the top six scoring teams get an additional win, while the bottom six get an additional loss), the standings would be as follows:

| White Panthers        |       2-6 (10)       |        4-12 (10)        |       30-58 (10)       |
| Unorthodox Rabbis     |       2-6 (11)       |        3-13 (11)        |       20-68 (11)       |
| Macdaddys             |       1-7 (12)       |        1-15 (12)        |       5-83 (12)        |
