Once is good, but twice is nice.

The Jeff City Leprechauns do it again in stunning fashion as they beat the Slayton Slayerz in the 2021 Chug Cup Final by a score of 146.40 to 135.00. It was a team effort as not one single Leprechaun scored more than 20.90 fantasy points.

Despite Jeff City's lackluster first Cup, their second championship was no fluke. The Leprechauns were tied for the 2nd best regular season record and scored in the top 4 of all teams, missing out on 2nd most points by 12.9 points, less than 1 fantasy point per game.

The Leprechauns will look to secure their 3rd straight Chug Cup in 2022 and assert their dominance as the Chug League's first and only dynasty.
