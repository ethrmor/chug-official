Right as the NFL preseason starts rolling, roster cuts are getting started as well. As the NFL requires teams to get down to a 53-man active roster, the Chug League also has their cut down day.

The 2022 cut day will occur on September 1, 2022 by 4pm. This will allow for teams to reconcile their rosters after the NFL's final cut day of August 30, 2022.

Final Chug rosters will need to be down to 38 total players, which includes 31 active roster spots, 5 taxi squad spots, and 2 optional IR spots.
