Sorry about last week. Too much going on and I didn't have the energy to update the numbers and write an article for Week 6.

Onto week 7, we're officially halfway through the 2022 Chug League season. Outside of an absolute travesty, we have the Leprechauns, Direwolves, and Redbirds cruising towards a playoff berth. A resurging Slayton Slayerz are finally looking like they're past their early season struggles and are charging towards a top 4 seed. The final two spots of the playoffs are looking like a four team race with the 45ers, Quarantine Cowboys, Kingston Kraken, and Outkasts.

Looking ahead, week 8 features a big matchup between the 4-3 Slayerz and 6-1 Direwolves.
