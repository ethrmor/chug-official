For the second time in as many weeks, the Outkasts and Direwolves get together in a seven piece trade.

The Direwolves receive RB Dalvin Cook and multiple fourth round picks in exchange for a 2024 first round pick and multiple depth pieces, including RB Devin Singletary, WR Josh Palmer, and TE Isaiah Likely.

This was a clear buy low opportunity for the Direwolves as they attempt to solidfy a leaky RB room. The team is now set up to feature a backfield of Christian McCaffrey, Cook, and Kareem Hunt, which puts them in the top tier of the league if those players can regain their 2020 forms and stay healthy.

The Outkasts were afforded the opportunity to continue to stack 2024 draft picks by dealing from a strength. The Outkasts still includes veterans Derrick Henry and Austin Ekeler, while the new additions are likely never to be anything beyond deep depth and potential future trade potential.

The Direwolves find themselves currently at 1-1, while the Outkasts are 0-2.
