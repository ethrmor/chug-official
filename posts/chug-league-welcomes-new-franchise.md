The Chug League would like to formally announce the addition of our newest franchise, the Rabbis. The Rabbis owner, Clint, will be a welcomed addition to the Alliance as he takes the spot of an original member.

As the Rabbis take over the spot vacated by the Baba Yagas, their 2022 entry fee will be cut in half as they have no 2023 first round pick. We wish the Clint and the Rabbis the best of luck.
