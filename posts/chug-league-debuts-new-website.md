It's finally here.

After months of development, the new internet home of the Chug League is live.

This new website was built in React on the Next.js framework and styled by TailwindCSS. The Sleeper API is used to retrieve rosters and owners. While the new Chug website is statically generated, it utilizes ISC so if something doesn't look updated, just give your browser a refresh. If it still doesn't change, I probably haven't gotten around to updating yet. During the season, I plan to update it weekly by Thursday Night Football.

Happy Football Season.
