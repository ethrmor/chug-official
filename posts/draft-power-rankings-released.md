As round 8 of the Alliance of Sunday Morning Chugs startup draft came to a close, the commissioner took a suggestion from the owner of the White Panthers franchise and asked for all league owners to submit a ranked list of individual drafts to this point. The Goathouse Alums came in as heavy favorites from the early rounds after grabbing Cook, Mahomes, and Kelce with his first 3 picks, despite drafting from the 7th spot in the draft.

Bringing up the rear, Baba Yagas finished with the lowest amount of votes and lowest standard deviation. The highly disregarded Slayton Slayerz owner finished second to last with a tally of 29. While many consider the Slayerz draft to be full of reaches, there's no doubt the upside is there.

Last of note, the 45ers scored a standard deviation of over 4, as he was voted either in the top 3 or bottom 3 by each of the 11 teams. The power rankings will be updated after round 16.
